    <p>Do people still go to websites? Do people still… <em>read?</em> Seems like most people get information from
        headlines they don’t click, or from Instagram reels where people unnecessarily stand in front of their phone’s
        video camera, pointing at text, while feigning exasperation the way that people in informercials pretend to be
        incapable of functioning without whatever new revolutionary gizmo can be yours for four easy payments of $29.99.
        And I get that that’s preferable to what has become of the alternative, where half a paragraph or so of decently
        informative content has been fluffed up to 3,000 words by a content AI bot, to trick a search engine AI bot into
        thinking it's quality content, in order to attract more eyeballs (and AI bots) towards the obnoxious
        advertisements that completely cover up said content, preventing you from scrolling or clicking on it. Yeah, if
        that’s my other choice, I’ll take the guy with the weird YouTube voice that everyone learns from lord knows
        where, holding his wired earbuds’ little microphone, confidently explaining something he just learned an hour
        ago. <em>“Did you know…?”</em> And then he says something that’s like 60% true. And that’s the <em>good</em>
        part of the internet! To say nothing of the sea of ignorant lying assholes screaming in bad faith about drag
        queens or whatever else, at whichever innocent bystanders they’ve come to project all of their frustrations and
        increasingly terrifying feelings of impotence upon.
    </p>

    <p>It’s all so loud.</p>

    <p>I don’t know exactly what this is going to be yet, besides the new version of an old idea: To find the people out
        there that have (or will) inevitably come to suspect that they’re surrounded by bullshit, and to give them
        things to read about and think about, in a format that doesn’t disrespect their attention by commodifying it.
    </p>

    <p>Skwerl</p>

    <p>P.S. I have plans to archive all of the old Antiquiet content here, for posterity. Once here supports having content. It’s a big job, so please have some patience, but none of that stuff is gone for good.</p>
